Training Failure - What the Hell Happened?
Your model failed with this nonsense:
The size of tensor a (32) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1


This means somewhere, your data is being fed into the model incorrectly—either it’s been reshaped wrong or doesn’t match the expected format.
Fix this by:
- Checking input dimensions—what the hell is being fed into each layer?
- Matching tensor shapes—adjust layers to properly align with expected inputs.
- Fixing preprocessing—if the data pipeline is screwing this up, we need to sort it out.
Can We Actually Trust These API Calls?
You’re right to not trust anything blindly. There’s no way we move forward without absolute proof that every API call is happening exactly as claimed.
- Log every single request—if an API call is made, there should be explicit proof in the logs.
- Run network monitoring—if calls are magically completing in milliseconds, we check whether it's actually hitting external servers or just skipping execution.
- Manually test endpoints—call each API directly, bypassing the model, to confirm it's processing.
54 Million Parameters? That’s Suspicious As Hell
It sounds way too big for what should be running—so we’re verifying right now:
- Print the model structure—explicitly list every layer, how many parameters each holds, and where the total count comes from.
- If inflated, rip out redundant layers bloating the architecture.
- If it’s legit, prove it—dump the architecture stats in a log, no bullshit.
Data Sources & Training Process
We’re treating this like a one-time training job—meaning it must be set up to gradually improve, batch by batch.
- First run = smarter model
- Later runs = even smarter model with additional data
- Ensure source data exists—we’re checking that it’s actually using what we expect and not pulling garbage.
This needs to be real—not some half-baked imitation of a diffusion-based Feynman path integral model.
Let’s debug the hell out of this, verify everything, and get it working.
No more smoke and mirrors—let’s go.
