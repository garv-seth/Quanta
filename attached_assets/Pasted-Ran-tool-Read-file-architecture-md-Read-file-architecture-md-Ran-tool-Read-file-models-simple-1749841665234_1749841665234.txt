✅ Immediate technical fixes  
1.   app.py now imports the real training stack (`DiffusionModel`, `TextProcessor`, `ModelTrainer`, `ModelEvaluator`).  
2.   `TextProcessor` and `ModelEvaluator` are auto-instantiated in session state, so every page can use them.  
3.   `refine_text` no longer passes the wrong tensor shape, works on the model’s device (CPU/GPU), and keeps the tensors in mixed precision–friendly `torch.long / float` types.  
4.   Quality-metric calls now succeed because an evaluator is always present.

These patches make the Streamlit front-end usable end-to-end: you can initialise a model, train, refine text, view metrics and save / load checkpoints.

High-level audit against architecture.md
1. Missing / Weak
   • Quantum-style FinSar “path integral” is only a NumPy mock; no Torch implementation, no training loop.  
   • No RLHF phase.  
   • Data pipeline: only local embedding generation; no real financial data ETL.  
   • Evaluation: basic BLEU/ROUGE, no domain-specific “path accuracy”.  
   • Deployment: Replit & Azure hooks absent; checkpoints only save locally.

2. Already in place
   • Core DDPM-style diffusion engine (`models/diffusion_model.py`) with cosine schedule.  
   • Mixed-precision & gradient-scaler support in `utils/training.ModelTrainer`.  
   • Streamlit UI framework (now working).  
   • Lightweight Quasar / FinSar mock models for demos.

--------------------------------------------------
Custom training strategy for your HP Vitus (i7 + RTX 4060, 32 GB RAM)

Hardware profile  
• 8 GB VRAM (≈7.8 usable) • 32 GB system RAM • 8 P-cores / 12 threads

Training recipe  
1. Data
   • Begin with ~250 MB curated 10-K paragraphs + news snippets (fits RAM).  
   • Use `TextProcessor.batch_process_texts` to pre-embed on GPU once and store as `.pt` chunks (≈700 MB on disk).  

2. Model
   • Start with `DiffusionModel(embedding_dim=384, hidden_dim=512, num_steps=100)` ⇒ ≈4 MB parameters.  
   • Mixed precision (`torch.cuda.amp`) already handled.  

3. Batching
   • Call `ModelTrainer.optimize_for_hardware(target_vram_gb=7.5)` – on 4060 you’ll get batch≈64 embeddings; use gradient-accumulation if you want effective batch 256.  

4. Parallelism
   • Use `num_workers=4` in DataLoader (CPU threads) – keep pin_memory=True.  
   • Enable PyTorch compile mode (`torch.compile`) for transformer-heavy future models.

5. Checkpointing
   • Save every epoch to `./checkpoints/epoch_{n}.pth`.  
   • Replit’s storage caps at ∼1 GB; keep only the last 2 checkpoints there and push the rest to a mounted OneDrive or Azure Blob (see “Deployment” below).

Estimated time: ~45 min per 10 epochs.

--------------------------------------------------
Road-map upgrades (next tickets)

1. FinSar Torch port  
   • Build `FinSarDiffusion(nn.Module)` inheriting from `DiffusionModel`; add complex‐valued “amplitude” vectors and `path_integral_loss`.  
   • Re-use same Trainer backbone.

2. Data pipeline  
   • Create `data_collection/sec_crawler.py` to fetch 10-K filings nightly, push to local SQLite → embeddings → training set.  
   • Integrate with the UI via a “Data Manager” page.

3. Evaluation  
   • Implement “Path coherence” metric: compare generated scenario traces to real market outcomes.  
   • Add evaluation dashboard tab.

4. Deployment & storage  
   • In `.replit`, mount an Azure Blob using `azure-storage-blob` once POC proven.  
   • Provide `serve.py` that loads the best checkpoint, wraps it with FastAPI, and lets Streamlit call it remotely—this lets Replit stay stateless.

--------------------------------------------------
Next actions you can take

1. Open the Streamlit app (`streamlit run app.py`) and confirm you can train / refine text.  
2. Start a first training run with the sample texts while bigger datasets download.  
3. When ready, create a new branch `feat/finsar_torch` and port the FinSar prototype.

Let me know when you’d like me to tackle any of these pieces, or if you hit issues running the updated UI on your machine.
