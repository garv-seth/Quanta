# Quanta: Financial Diffusion Language Models Architecture

## Project Vision & Mission

**Quanta** is an ambitious project to build the world's first production-ready **Diffusion-based Large Language Model (dLLM)** specifically designed for financial applications. Our mission is to revolutionize financial AI by applying quantum-inspired diffusion principles to create more reliable, controllable, and interpretable financial language models.

## Core Innovation: FinSar (Financial Feynman Path Integral Diffusion)

### The Breakthrough Concept

**FinSar** represents a paradigm shift in financial AI by implementing Richard Feynman's path integral formulation within language models. Just as photons explore all possible paths in quantum mechanics, FinSar explores all possible financial narratives before converging on the most probable outcome.

### Why This Matters

Traditional financial AI models provide single predictions with limited uncertainty quantification. FinSar provides:
- **Multiple scenario exploration** (like quantum superposition)
- **Probabilistic convergence** (path interference)
- **Uncertainty as a feature** (not a bug)
- **Interpretable decision paths** (traceable reasoning)
